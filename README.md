# mit-single-page-application
## What is this project?
In this project, I was writing codes in order to make a website in which routing will be working. In relationship with instructions given to me, I learnt many things about routing and how to use it correctly, so the website pages can contact each other.
## How to run this project?
To run this project the only thing you have to do is to take the files with the same structure as they are in the GitHub. Then, you have to run them on your computer to a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
## Which things have been improved on that project?
This project has not many differences from the first one that was given to me. I just made some styling changes and I removed the links that were located below the bootstrap NavBar. Of course the routing that was happening to the links below the bootstrap NavBar have been re-located to the bootstrap NavBar, so it works good.
